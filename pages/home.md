# Hi, I'm Zayyan Faizal.

I'm a Systems Engineering & Design student with a Computer Science specialization at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. I expect to graduate in May 2022

Currently, I'm working on PerForm: Perfect Form which is a mobile app which provides instant, actionable feedback on weight lifting technique to minimize injuries and maximize performance. If you're interested in fitness, biomechanics, entrepreneurship, or computer vision, feel free to reach out.
