# Hi, I'm Zayyan.

I'm a Systems Engineering & Design student with a Computer Science specialization at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Here you can find some of my previous projects, Medium blog posts, and designs.

I'm currently involved with [Hack4Impact](https://uiuc.hack4impact.org/) as a product designer to build software for non-profits and [Alpha Phi Omega](apo-aa.org) where I spend my time giving back to the community.
