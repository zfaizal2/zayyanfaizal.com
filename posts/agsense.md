AgSense was built at the first AGCO Hackathon at the NCSA building with my friends Jared, Sohail, and Mehul. I was really interested in software and agtech at the time (still am), so I thought this was a great opportunity to act on that. Though we didn't win anything, it was great exposure to what issues farmers face, building something quickly, and lots of fun for my first hackathon. 

Our team decided to tackle the challenge of helping farmers and combines operators use data to be more efficient in the field. Current combine operator solutions provided 50+ parameters of combine diagnostics in complex ways on an iPad app. Imagine driving your car and instead of a speedometer & tachometer, you were shown a graph of speed over time... not helpful.

AgSense is a dashboard interface for combine operators to understand the most critical components of their combine in an actionable manner.

Important parameters of the combine were organized by groups such as efficiency, engine, yield, etc. and values are placed in color-coded boxes 
from red to green to reflect optimal ranges. A red box indicate to the combine operator to change that parameter for performance. 

Our team used HTML, Python, and JavaScript to build this web platform.
