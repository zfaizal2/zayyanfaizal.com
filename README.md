I made this personal website showcasing projects and blog posts based on a template using the [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.io/) static site generator, with [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/) baked-in, ready to deploy to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) in a couple of clicks.

Based on the [Eleventy Base Blog](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-base-blog) repo (see there for additional info on Eleventy usage).

ðŸ”¥ **I found this project featured on Netlify's official [template showcase](https://templates.netlify.com/template/eleventy-netlify-boilerplate/)** ðŸ”¥

Thanks to [Dan Urbanowicz](https://www.danurbanowicz.com/) for this great template.
